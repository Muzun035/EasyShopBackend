# EasyShop Project

## Description of the Project

The **EasyShop** project is a dynamic e-commerce platform built using Spring Boot for the backend and MySQL for the database. It provides users with an intuitive online shopping experience, allowing them to register, browse products across various categories, and filter items based on specific preferences such as price and color.

This project aims to create a robust backend infrastructure, enabling smooth functionality and offering a seamless experience for both customers and administrators.

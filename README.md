# EasyShop Project

## Description of the Project

The **EasyShop** project is a dynamic e-commerce platform built using Spring Boot for the backend and MySQL for the database. It provides users with an intuitive online shopping experience, allowing them to register, browse products across various categories, and filter items based on specific preferences such as price and color. Admins have full control over managing the product catalog and categories, including the ability to add, update, or remove items. This project aims to create a robust backend infrastructure, enabling smooth functionality and offering a seamless experience for both customers and administrators.

## User Stories

- As an **Admin**, I want to add new products to the inventory to expand the variety of items available to customers.
- As an **Admin**, I want to update existing product information, such as price or description, so that the product catalog reflects the most accurate data.
- As an **Admin**, I want to be able to retrieve a list of all categories, so I can see the entire catalog structure at a glance.
- As an **Admin**, I want to fetch the details of a specific category using its ID, so I can review and make updates to the categoryâ€™s attributes.
- As an **Admin**, I want to be able to add new categories to the system so that I can organize products into more relevant classifications.
- As an **Admin**, I want the ability to edit existing categories, so I can modify their names, descriptions, or other important details.
- As an **Admin**, I want to remove outdated or unnecessary categories from the system so that the catalog remains organized and up-to-date.
- As a **User**, I want to view detailed product information, so I can make informed decisions before making a purchase.
